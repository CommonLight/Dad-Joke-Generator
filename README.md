# Dad-Joke-Generator
A fun little practice project I made during the Web Basics Class of Coding Dojo.

This project was inspired by a TA in school when she challenged me to make a dad joke app (here it is Christina!!). I was able to figure out most things with this project except for the displaying of random jokes in the speech balloon... for this I gleaned ideas and info from StackOverflow and ChatGPT. ChatGPT was particularly helpful in getting things working and explaining exactly what parts of the JavaScript code was doing what... it's a very useful tool for learning!
